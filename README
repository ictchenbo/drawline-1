	Author: Jiyuan Lin
	Email: linjiyuan90@gmail.com

Support:
	CONCEPT, REGEX,	MCONCEPT, MCONCEPT_RULE
	OR, AND, ORD, SENT, DIST_K

Compile:
	make
or if you only want to make libdrawline.a,
	make lib
and libdrawline.a will be in lib directory.

To comiple libdrawline.a wih your own cpp, you need these files:
	libdrawline.a, drawline.h, drawline_ds.h
and include drawline.h in your own cpp, then compile:
	g++ your.cpp -oyour -ldrawline -Llib

src/drawline_driver.cpp is an example of using drawline.


Usage:
	./drawline cfg txt >out 2>err


There are two datasets to test, please execute run.sh.
The results will be *.out, *.err.
(*.out record the extract results, while *.err record time consumptions)
When compiled with -O2, the total time is 6s for exception datasets, and 
without -O2, it needs 23s.
Note dataset MTIE, some configurations are not supported so the result may be 
a little different with *.ref.


Note
	CONCEPT:CTY:中国
	CONCEPT:GOV:政府
	MCONCEPT:ALL:CTYGOV
	#              ^
	# Don't add space between CTY, GOV, otherwise the space will be treated as 
	# a character need to match
	# Don't worry, Drawline will extract 中国政府.
	# Don't add extra spaces(that you don't want to match) at the begin/end.


TODO list:

1. Special case of sentence delimiter, for example,
   	"Number 123.45 is", should not treat '.' as sentence delimiter here.
